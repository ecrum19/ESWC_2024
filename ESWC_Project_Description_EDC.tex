\begin{abstract}
	Medical care is in the process of becoming increasingly personalized through the use of patient genetic information. 
	At present, digital data useful for clinical care is commonly diffuse, organized arbitrarily, and stored in data silos. 
  Unstructured organization, high cost data storage and generation, and tight privacy restrictions pose serious challenges to scaling personalized clinical strategies.
  I propose an early stage Ph.D. that aims to improve the connectedness and shareability of genomic data storage(s), while preserving data privacy, through the integration of various domains of semantic web research into a novel, wholistic framework designed for use in clinical practice. 
	To create this framework, I propose the integration of (a) storage of patient data using Solid pods, (b) represention of personal genome sequence data in Resource Description Format as Linked Data, (c) attachment of policies to stored data, and (d) querying of data through link traversal process queries into a single, unified workflow with an accompanying web application.

	Preliminarily, I have succeeded in storing genomic data in representative patient data pods using Solid specifications.

\section{Introduction / Motivation}
\begin{comment}
Give a general introduction to the domain/area/topic and indication of its importance/impact in Semantic Web research or other domains.
\end{comment}

As our understanding of genomics deepens, the role of Personal Genome Sequencing (PGS) in healthcare is expanding. 
At the time of writing, there are multiple domains of clinical practice where patient PGS data is now used to inform medical decision making. 
Examples include in drug development \cite{ko_new_2022}, cancer diagnosis and treatment \cite{mcleod_cancer_2013}, and rare genetic disease identification and treatment \cite{souche_recommendations_2022}.
How this integration is deployed varies by clinical domain, but improved outcomes have generally been observed \cite{mathur_personalized_2017}.
Despite great promise presented by various use cases, barriers to adoption remain \cite{stefanicka-wojtas_barriers_2023}. 
One major challenge is presented by the digital representation, storage, and access to the PGS data that underlies clinical usage.
With the PENGQUIN project, I aim to address the challenges presented by PGS data usage in clinical practice by leveraging  decentralized storage, data representation, and querying technologies.  

\textbf{PGS data storage and sharing} 
PGS data are expensive to both generate and store. 
The average human genome is slightly over 3 billion base pairs in length (3 Gbp). 
During a whole genome sequencing workflow, various sequence formats that offer different sets of information are produced (see \textit{Bagger et al.} for a comprehensive review \cite{bagger_whole_2024}).
Of these, Variant Call Format (VCF) files \cite{danecek_variant_2011} serve as the state-of-the-art for most clinical genomic applications.
VCF files are typically between 100-1000s MB (0.1-1 GB) within computer memory and represent around 3 million nucleotide positions of an individual\textquotesingle s PGS. 

For these genomic data there are also significant privacy considerations.
Unfortunately, the relationship between privacy and cost is largely antagonistic within the current technological framework.
Increases in privacy protections often leads to increases in data siloing and increased costs for both patient and provider.
To make PGS data usage in healthcare more scalable, decreases in costs and preservation, or improvement of, current privacy standards stored data are required.
One strategy for reducing costs is through increased data sharing and data discoverability between hospital systems.
Another increase in efficiency could be achieved by greater connectivity of a single patient\textquotesingle s data, such as previous test results, PGS data, medical history, etc.
Increasing patient data connectedness and accessibility for authorized users is not a trivial problem while also maintaining privacy.
It is at this crossroads that the current state-of-the-art in clinical data storage technology is largely incapable of achieving both goals.

\textbf{A Solid Solution} 
A possible solution to the challenges faced is through reorganization of how data is stored and discovered. 
The citizen-centric model places the patient at the center, and is not an entirely novel concept \cite{brands_patient-centered_2022}.
Within the current system, a citizen-centric model is difficult to implement due to technological challenges presented by centralized databases.
The Solid protocol \cite{capadisli_solid_nodate}, a decentralized data storage approach, is composed of specifications more conducive to construction of a citizen-centrical data storage strategy for clinical data.
Specifically, Solid offers the ability to granularize data privacy, allow authorized data access over the web, and represent stored data as Linked Data, all features that can work to remove some of the antagonism between cost reduction and privacy preservation.


\textbf{Project Motivation.}
Despite there being no real solutions to the current antagonism between privacy and cost reduction for PGS data usage in healthcare, there is also a conspicuous gap in the current scientific discourse around the development and implementation of a proposed solution. 
This gap underscores the necessity of my Ph.D.
I aim to improve the connectedness and shareability of genomic data storage(s), while preserving data privacy, through the integration of various domains of semantic web research into a novel, wholistic framework designed for use in clinical practice. 
My Ph.D. will also aim to demonstrate the limitations of current state-of-the-art semantic web technologies in this novel application domain with the intention of driving innovation and discovering future research pursuits.


\section{State of the Art}
\begin{comment}
Describe existing work in the area, work focusing on the same/similar problems or that might be useful to tackling your research question.
\end{comment}

\subsection{Current State of the Art -- Clinical data storage}
Currently, most clinically relevant health data, including PGS data, is stored using an \textbf{institution-centric approach} characterized by the hospital or hospital system isolating all of its stored data into one or more centralized databases that are governed and maintained solely by the owner institution. 
Centralized storage being that a single node, the system that hosts the physical data storage, has control over managing database content, access, and permissions.
In recent years there has also been a large transition to cloud-based data storage. 
Within these systems, relational database structures are predominantly used to organize data stores with alternative non-relational methods like NoSQL or RDF being proposed in recent years[c].

Regardless of the 

prioritize patient data privacy over all other digital data storage considerations. 
By prioritizing patient data privacy, access is commonly only allowed for authorized users within the institution\textquotesingle s internal network. 
Crucially, this institution-centric data storage architecture, by design, allows for little to no accessibility for users or data usage requests that originate outside of the institution\textquotesingle s network, largely due to the organizational design of such centralized data storage systems. 
With the enlarged threat of hacking, phishing, and login credential compromisation that seems to only be increasing \cite{noauthor_ransomware_nodate}, hospitals and institutions that maintain patient PGS data are forced to enact tighter regulation over data access within their institution, severely limit outside institution access, and increase the in-house cyber security staff or pay for external companies to handle such security audits.  
Due to this isolation of patient PGS data to a single institution, data duplication leading to increased storage and data generation costs, severely limited patient data usage transparency, and severely limited potential for data sharing are observed. 
Collectively, these state-of-the-art approaches to PGS data storage inhibit the scalability of PGS data usage in the above discussed clinical applications due to raising PGS usage costs.

\textbf{PGS data sharing in academic research.}
In the realm of academic research, the development of infrastructure that allows for sharing of genome data between institutions has gained traction recently. 
Initiatives such as GA4GH Beacons \cite{rambla_beacon_2022} and others are building infrastructure for between institution data sharing. 
The major drawbacks of these proposed solutions are, (a) the requirement that data is anonymized for true sharing or, (b) control of data analysis is relinquished to the data\textquotesingle s home institution, thereby establishing federated networks of hospital data for data discoverability, but restricting actual access to such data for privacy reasons.
Despite great progress in the research domain, advancements in state-of-the-art infrastructure and standards are not directly translatable to clinical practice largely because clinical application was never their goal. 

\rt{A more fundamental research line I see here is that existing initiatives focus on federation/distribution, while you want to focus on decentralization. The difference is that the former still relies on central coordinators, while the latter does not. This avoids single points of failure or attack targets.}

\subsubsection{Solid, RDF, and Linked Data in clinical practice}


\rt{Not sure this section is going in the right direction. I would suggest the following flow: most query research focuses on centralized use cases; recent work has shown effectiveness of link traversal in decentralized environments; but this work assumes small-ish datasets, while PGS data is huge!; Therefore, we need to extend these link traversal algos to work with huge datasets, which may require additional structural assumptions (taelman_evaluation_2023)}


\textbf{Link Traversal Query Processing}
With the representation of PGS data as RDF, approaches to parsing and querying that data must also be investigated, especially to encourage leveraging the greatest utility from the linked nature of representing PGS data as Linked Data.
The querying of Linked Data is a well established challenge, especially for large datasets \cite{taelman_evaluation_2023}.
I forsee the main challenges posed by link traversal in general contexts as less daunting within our proposed framework because most work where significant challenges were observed were with generalized, web-scale querying \cite{taelman_evaluation_2023}. 
Here, I am proposing a relatively small number of links within a large, known dataset. 
Query processing over a large dataset is made more performant through following strategies such as query planning.
Query planning involves the maximization of query performance based on cost estimations based on data and query type. 
Additional underlying strategies such as the use of MapReduce frameworks for query execution optimization can also improve query performance through the use of query decomposition and parallel processing \cite{shim_mapreduce_2013}.  


\section{Problem Statement and Contributions}
\begin{comment}
Formulate the problem you intend to solve, and how you intend to contribute to Semantic Web research. This section should include a clear formulation of one (or very few) research hypothesis (what statement you want to validate through your methodology, approach and evaluation), and/or the research questions that need to be answered.
\end{comment}

My research project is situated to provide a proof-of-concept PGS data storage and sharing framework that can be adapted to use for clinical practice. 
In this pursuit, my core research questions are: 
(A) Can a citizen-centric PGS data storage framework, developed using a decentralized storage technology, offer data sharing infrastructure while maintaining privacy safeguards for sensitive data? 
(B) Can PGS data be stored as RDF, be linked to other medically-relevant data, and be queried over in a ways that would be useful to clinical practice.
To address these central questions, I will investigate the use of data pods, implemented using Solid protocol, to store PGS data in a decentralized and privacy-oriented ecosystem while addressing technical challenges associated with data policies, representation of PGS data as Linked Data, discoverability through querying, and infrastructure that connects data pods to existing clinical workflows and tools. 
My hypothesis is that such a framework can be developed and would offer unique advantages over the existing state-of-the-art institution-centric PGS data storage solutions. 

The following six objectives will be undertaken to test my hypotheses through experimental production and testing of different modules of the proposed framework.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Solid Pod PGS Data Storage
  \item Genomic data as Linked Data
  \item Data policies and sharing infrastructure
  \item Data querying
  \item Framework deployment
\end{enumerate}

Together, these objectives will serve as the components of an operational framework that uses the proposed methods for storing, sharing, linking, and querying PGS data for clinical use. 
The framework, once produced, will be compared to existing strategies for storing and sharing PGS data to assess the efficacy of transitioning toward product production and marketing.
The proposed scientific approach also aims to provide novel applicaitons for numerous fields of semantic web research. 
Explicitely, an approach to how decentralized storage specifications can be applied to sensitive medical data storage, how genomic and medical data can be represented and queried as Linked Data, how existing Linked Data querying algorithms perform over genomic and health data, how granularized data policies impact querying and linking data in a medical context, and how the combination of these semantic technologies could provide an improvement over existing state-of-the-art clinical PGS data storage and usage strategies, are specific questions my Ph.D. aims to answer.


\section{Research Methodology and Approach}
\begin{comment}
Describe the research methodology you will apply in your research, including the different steps from the formulation of your research questions to answering them. Also describe the approach you are taking (or you intend to take for Early Stage Ph.D. submissions) to instantiate the research methodology, hence contributing to solve the problem described in Section 3 and confirm or reject your hypothesis. Discuss how this approach is innovative and novel, and how it is (might be) implemented.
\end{comment}

My project will be split into four different component work packages and a final fifth work package where the components will be deployed as a cohesive framework within a web application.

2. how do you plan to test hypothesis
3. how is the approach novel / how it is implemented
\end{comment}

\subsection{Work Package 1: Storing and publishing personal genomic data in a decentralized environment} 

I will test the viability of Solid data pods as storage infrastructure for patient PGS data, thus, testing my hypothesis that Solid can support PGS data storage. 

A test dataset will be constructed using publicly available Illumina platinum genome files \cite{noauthor_platinum_nodate}. 
These files will be used as representative "patient" PGS data for the project. 

I will also create server-hosted Solid pods that are representative of individual patient Solid pods using the Community Solid Server (CSS) implementation of Solid \cite{css}. 
Each pod will be a storage container for a single individual\textquotesingle s PGS data. 
We will create a representative patient\textquotesingle s pod by upload a single PGS file, a VCF file, into that pod to test basic functionality of a Solid pod for hosting patient data. 
For the purpose of uploading and viewing PGS data to patient pods, a simple online web-application will be built.
The use of the CSS for Solid pod hosting for research purposes is state-of-the-art, but there have been no published experiments documenting the use of Solid pods for storing PGS data. 

\rt{What is missing here IMO are the challenges related to dataset site, which are unconventional in Solid pods at the moment. The ESWC audience will be mainly interested in hearing those, and how you want to tackle that (e.g. store compressed data and convert to RDF on-the-fly)}


\subsection{Work Package 2:  Storing PGS data in RDF and as Linked Data}

I hypothesize that the conversion from VCF to RDF is possible, and the resulting RDF representation will allow for linking of other medically relevant data within the patient\textquotesingle s pod and outside of it.
The conversion process will be made reversible to enable connection to existing clinical workflows that request VCF format. 

To convert PGS data from VCF to RDF, we will investigate a format translation process using the SPHN RDF ontology \cite{van_der_horst_bridging_2023}. 
During this translation process, we will experiment with different approaches, such as a bidirectional mapping index, for maintaining a map between the VCF and RDF to reverse the process efficiently.
Because representation of VCF files in RDF has not been heavily studied, these will be the first experiments of their kind.

I then intend to demonstrate the linking of part of a patient\textquotesingle s genome to
(A) other data within the patient\textquotesingle s pod, 
(B) data in a public database outside of a patient\textquotesingle s pod, and
(C) data from another patient\textquotesingle s pod.

While Linked Data is state-of-the-art, these concepts have not yet been applied to clinical genomic data.
The power of linking the VCF data to other clinically relevant data will be especially realized when these semantic links are discovered during querying, which will be investigated in WP5. 


\subsection{Work Package 3: PGS data privacy policies}

In this work package, I will experiment with the design and implementation of multiple levels of authorization as well as methods that allow for dynamic control over data discoverability, read/write access, and data access consent requests within a patient\textquotesingle s Solid pod. 
I hypothesize that various levels of authorization can be implemented and provide protections for maintaining the privacy of PGS data stored in Solid pods.

I will develop and test three functionalities for privacy modifications.
(1) A method that allows for registering the pod to an individual patient.
(2) A method that allows for the submission of a request to access stored data from a data requester, the notification of the patient, and the consent or denial by the patient.
(3) A method where the patient can rescind permission for access to their data as well as an opt-in option to share their data with researchers. 
All of these methods will be integrated into the framework\textquotesingle s web application.

To utilize these methods, various levels of access to pod read and write privileges will be created to fill the needs and roles of participants of a PGS clinical workflow. 
With varying levels of access, these privacy restrictions can show the nuanced ways in which permissions can be controlled and reflected within the framework schema.

Assigning the above permissions within Solid is an open area of research and there are currently some state-of-the-art protocols for similar implementations. [c]
The described access schema has not been attempted in the presented level of detail for clinical genomic data.


\subsection{Work Package 4: Querying over PGS data in one and many pods}

This work package will establish a querying mechanism for data in the patient Solid pods that takes into account patient pod data, user permissions, and data linkages. 
I hypothesize that a querying functionality that utilizes a query engine computational strategy will be able to query over patient Solid pods and return query results.

I aim to test this hypothesis by executing queries across PGS data contained patient pod(s) through the use of the query language SPARQL \cite{sparql}.
Query execution requires a source for computation which is not currently provided by the Solid pods themselves.
I will investigate the use of a client-side query engine, such as that offered by Comunica \cite{comunica}, to perform the queries apart from the datastores.

For PGS data querying, I will benchmark and potentially build upon the link traversal query processing (LTQP) paradigm \cite{taelman_evaluation_2023}, which has been shown to be an effective method for querying within a decentralized environment such as Solid. 
LTQP is known to currently perform sub-optimally for larger dataset sizes and complex queries \cite{taelman_evaluation_2023}. 
I will look to innovate and improve performance by combining existing algorithms with strategies that leverage the unique structure of PGS data.
One strategy that I may investigate is the use of pre-computed indexes, like the one generated for RDF-VCF conversion, as a guide for faster query processing.

LTQP algorithms are an active area of active research, but most of the work done has been in respect to generalized algorithms.
I aim to adapt this querying approach to the specific domain of genomic and health data which has not been attempted before. 


\subsection{Work Package 5: Component consolidation and framework deployment}

In an effort to improve data flows for research purposes, I intend to connect the proposed framework to the international Beacon initiative \cite{rambla_beacon_2022} to increase the availability of genomic data for researchers. 
In this aim we will investigate the necessary requirements and infrastructure necessary to connect patient Solid pods, containing PGS data, as beacon endpoints that can be discoverable and queried via the Beacon API. 
The connection of a decentralized, citizen-centric storage framework to the Beacon network is novel in nature as all other existing endpoints are institution-centric relational databases maintained by hospitals or research institutions.

All other functionalities will also be packaged into a web application with supporting documentation for final deployment and exhibition of how such a framework could function in clinical practice.
This framework would be the first of its kind.

\section{Evaluation/Evaluation Plan}
\begin{comment}
Describe your evaluation or evaluation plan, which is the way you (intend to) validate your hypothesis, your results, and the value of your approach.
\end{comment}

\textbf{WP1}.
The test dataset will be assembled by downloading the illumina platnum genome sequences from their public github repository.
Solid pods must be created and deployed using the CSS specifications and hosted as either local servers or dedicated web-connected servers.
The uploading of data to these solid pods will be achieved through the development of a simple web application that provides methods for the upload and management of patient Solid pod data. 
After such an application is developed, the test data can then be uploaded to the patient Solid pods, signaling success.

\textbf{WP2}.
For the conversion of VCF formatted PGS files, a mapping script must be developed that converts the VCF file contents into RDF using an ontology like the SPHN RDF ontology. 
The conversion process will be recorded in an intermediate mapping file so that the cost of forwards and backwards mapping can be compared to that of storing both files within the patient Solid pod. 
This comparison will be documented in a formal benchmarking study to compare the computational, time, and storage costs.
Once data is formatted into RDF, we will assess the potential for linking medical data to genomic data (how? not sure...)

\textbf{WP3}
Attaching various levels of authorization to data will be assessed by creating various profiles that reflect clinical roles such as patient, physician, researcher, etc. 
Data access requests, role-specific access, and access denial will be tested within this implementation by altering the associated read and write permissions in pod .acp files.
These different actions for different roles within the framework will be tested and integrated into the web applciation for viewing and adding data to patient data pods. 

\textbf{WP4}
Query engine functionality will be evaluated over a single solid pod first, then over many patient solid pods. 
A catalogue of different clinically-relevant queries for both genomic and linked data will be assembled for benchmarking.
Existing LTQP algorithms within Comunica will be benchmarked for the assessment of time, computational load, and query results.
Altered query algorithms that utilize the genomic index files will be benchmarked using the same queries and compared to the vanilla algorithms.
All query functionality will be integrated into the framework web application with example queries and documentation for non-experts.

\textbf{WP5}
Patient Solid pods will be added as endpoints connected to the Beacon API in some manner. 
Queries over the data will be run by the Comunica query functionality.
This will necessitate conversion of API requests to queries as well as outputs to formats requested by the Beacon API.

The unified web application will be developed into a demonstration and its functionality assessed over simulated clinical use cases.

\rt{Which metrics will you be measuring for each WP? These are necessary to validate your hypotheses.}

\section{Results}
\begin{comment}
Results: Report the results achieved up to now in applying your approach in this section. Preliminary results are fine.
\end{comment}

During the first months of my Ph.D. project, I have been able to begin work on WP1. 
Within WP1, I have successfully assembled the test dataset and set up CSS pod instances hosted on a local machine.
I have also been able to successfully upload VCF files into these pods using the Pod browsing application Penny \cite{penny}. 
I am just finishing up a bare-bones, but functional, Pod data viewing and uploading web application of my own where the other project modules will be integrated as my project progresses.


\section{Conclusions/Lessons Learned}
\begin{comment}
Present your conclusions and lessons learned. Describe how your results will or might impact research or the world at large. We do neither expect you to have solved all issues nor expect you to have finished your Ph.D. However, we expect you to show an understanding of your research area in general and to have a clear plan towards addressing your research questions. This symposium is the best place to discuss these issues and plans with experienced researchers and fellow students to get informed feedback.
\end{comment}

With the emergence of patient genomic data as a tool for clinicians, establishing the infrastructure for patient genomic data sharing that maintains patient data privacy is an economic niche that is largely unfilled. 
Further, if such infrastructure begins being deployed, it will likley lead to efficiency increases and reduced costs resulting in increased usage of PGS data in clinical care and a positive feedback loop for the market.
A hypothetical company that, in coordination with policy makers and regulatory bodies, creates a scalable storage and data sharing infrastructure for genomic data, which could also grow to include all patient health data in time, stands to change the way our healthcare system functions. 

My project's framework is poised to provide the outline of necessary implementation considerations from a technological perspective while also highlighting strengths and weaknesses that will help assess scalibility of such an infrastructure. 
In the short-term, the project is being developed to be integrated into ongoing research and product development at VITO Digital Precision Health. 
Products aimed at improving the way drug prescription is practiced by using a genetic screening tool that leverages documented genetic predispositions to drug ineffectiveness are currently being developed to be connected to my framework of Solid pod stored PGS data. 
More generally, my project is designed to show the potential in representing genomic and clinical data as Linked Data while aiming to catalyze development of medically-relevant web applications, similar to those in the consumer market, that are designed to work with the presented more private and transparent citizen-centric data storage infrastructure.
With my proposed framework, improved transparency, when paired with decreased risk of large-scale data leaks, is likely to be well-received by the general public and that support could help drive framework adoption at a national or even European scale.
