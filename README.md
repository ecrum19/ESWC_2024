** poor Research Questions **

--> potential to make novel research contributions in the field of semantic web especially related to data storage, indexing, and privacy, but these are not well highlighted in the manuscript.


Reviewer 2 Feedback:
A. How are you specifically going to link patient data? -- be more explicit (even if this is more future work)
B. Risks should be more specific -- Solid pods are unable to accomidate large data / LTQP are only for a subset of queries - what about the others?

C. In intro -- "data siloing and increased costs for both patient and provider". Why does data siloing increase costs in this setting? Isn't centralisation / data siloing often worse for privacy, but better for efficiency? 

D. Figure 1 is a bit difficult to follow since there is no clear "flow". Maybe the diagram could be labelled (A), (B), (C), etc., or similar, and the caption could then describe what happens at (A), (B), (C), etc.

E. Grammar and typos -- 
* "current privacy standards [for] stored data are required"
* "of a citizen-centric[] data storage"
* "for this between institution data sharing" -> "for sharing data between institutions."
* "which are much larger than [the datasets used?] in past Solid experimentation"
* "with generalized algorithms and different ..." Incomplete sentence.
* "including test data[]set"
* "I have also successfully upload[ed]"


Reviewer 3 Feedback:
** poor research questions **

A. look at the biomedical literature since several authors considered thepossibility of representing genomic data semantically.
Then, I invite the author to perform an analysis of the UMLS knowledge base to verify if there are existing conceptual models specifically though for the representing genomic data.

B. did you perform a careful analysis of the computation costs needed to enable your solution to both store and process linked genomes and compare them with existing solutions?

C. besides genome linking, what are the other benefits of using semantic technologies?

D. Third, limitations should be better highligthed.
